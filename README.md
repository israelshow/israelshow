A Mobile Software Developer who specializes in using software engineering tools to help organizations change the world.

I've spent the last few years working on a number of amazing projects: landing pages, a browser extension, and an online conference app for event planners. I'm in the top 1% of active GitHub users in my country, which is a small brag but something I'm really proud of.

I've developed extensive knowledge in:
Front-End: JavaScript | React | Redux | jQuery | HTML5 | CSS3 | SASS | Tailwind
Back-End: Ruby | Rails | MySQL | Nodejs | Express | MongoDB
Tools & Methods: Git | GitHub | Heroku | Netlify | Mobile/Responsive Development | TDD | Chrome Dev Tools | Webpack.
Professional: Advanced Technical Writing  | Documentation  | Remote Pair-Programming |  Teamwork | Mentoring | Project Management.

Passionate about ideating, conceptualizing, and producing consumer-centric technology and technology-enabled products from level zero. Open for exploring exciting full-stack development opportunities in startups as well as companies with scale.
